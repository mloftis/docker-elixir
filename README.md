This image builds off of the elixir image, but only for the "fat" builds.  It adds Pg client and GMP libs.

More things to come as needed for my own use, but, feel free to use this for yours.  I won't be removing anything from the builds only adding to them, check the Dockerfile's to see what
packages get added.  For general use elixir, please use the official images!
